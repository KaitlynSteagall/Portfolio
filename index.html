                  <p id="aboutMe">Hello and welcome! My name is Kaitlyn Steagall and I'm a full stack developer, with a focus on front-end
                    development. 
                    <br /><br />
                    I have experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript/JQuery, React, and more! Creating visually attractive and easy-to use 
                    web applications makes me feel fulfilled. It allows me to bring out my creative side and utilize my desire to use 
                    logic and pay attention to small details. Being detail oriented is something all of my former managers and teammates 
                    would list as one of my strengths and is something I pride myself on. I am eager to learn and grow as a webdev and individual 
                    and always excited to contribute everything I can to my team.
                    <br /><br />
                    Check out my reviews, portfolio, and resume to learn about me professionally! And if you click on my picture, learn 
                    a little about me as an individual.

                            "As Kaitlyn's full-stack bootcamp instructor, I immediately recognized her natural talents as a developer. 
                            She posses a keen eye for design and seemed to easily comprehend the full web dev stack. When it came time to 
                            turn project ideas into a spec and UI flow, Kaitlyn was first in class, every time. I often used her work as an 
                            example. I also witnessed her ability to act as a team member and handle project adversity without skipping a beat. 
                            Any team in a position to add Kaitlyn as a new member should consider themselves lucky."

                            "I worked with Kaitlyn on a project with two other people, and she is a joy to collaborate with. 
                            She is responsive, eager to contribute, and has a talent for design and organization. Kaitlyn really cares about 
                            creating a quality product, and puts in the time to do some research and take her work that extra mile. 
                            Anything she doesn't know right away she looks into, and I've seen her time and again make that deep dive to add 
                            that extra flash to her work. She knows how to be a productive and supportive team player, and would be an asset to 
                            any professional environment. I would absolutely work with Kaitlyn again."

                            in what seems like the first five minutes and then moved on to diligently start building a solid control architecture. 
                            She more than pulls her weight in any team, always maintaining lines of communication, keeping up a steady stream of good 
                            PR submissions and approvals, and fluidly working where needed to make sure the job gets done and done well. She does her 
                            research, learns new libraries quickly, and I'd happily work with her again at any time."

                            We worked together on a group project together during our full stack web development certificate program, 
                            and Kaitlyn was a very involved team member. She communicates well with her team about what she's doing. 
                            She holds herself to a very high standard and always presents polished work. 
                            Even when she was unsure how to do something, she put in the time and figured it out. Her sense of color, 
                            spacing, and layout are spot on. I highly recommend Kaitlyn for any web design / UI/UX / web developer / 
                            front-end developer positions."
